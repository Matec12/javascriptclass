/*A client requires an application to help determine the ranks in a group of four football teams. 
The criteria to use in ranking these teams (in a particular order) are 

- Points Earned
- Goal Difference

System Flow

Given a group with team A, B, C, D. Team A will only rank 
first if it had superior Points and
Goal Difference to Team B-D and vice-versa. 
Make Provisions for a tie where any of the teams have
the same Goal Difference and Points. In case of a tie,
alert the name of the teams that tied and
the positions that each would share. 

Good Luck
