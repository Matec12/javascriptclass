/*A school name “Matec Secondary School” request an application to help calculate their student grades for three subjects (Mathematics,
 Physics and Chemistry) .
The grades are structured as:
A: 100> score >89
B: 89> score >60
C: 60> score >50
D: 50> score >40
F: <40.

For every student that uses the application to check there grades. The flow should be as follow:

1. Display a prompt to welcome the student to the application arena and ask for the student name. E.g “welcome to .... school”
2. Display a confirm with message “are you ready to grade your score” if yes let user proceed to step 3 else show “application terminated”.
3. For each subjects, display a prompt to ask for student score. E.g “ what’s your score in mathematics “
4. For every student subject score . Display remarks for them. E.g “Physics: Excellent”
5. Finally output the subject which the student has the highest score. If there exist more than one scenario output all of the subjects 

Remarks
A: excellent 
B: very good 
C: good
D: fair
F: poor

1000pts
Goodluck

Task 3

A client requires an application to help determine the ranks in a group of four football teams. 
The criteria to use in ranking these teams (in a particular order) are 

- Points Earned
- Goal Difference

System Flow

Given a group with team A, B, C, D. Team A will only rank 
first if it had superior Points and
Goal Difference to Team B-D and vice-versa. 
Make Provisions for a tie where any of the teams have
the same Goal Difference and Points. In case of a tie,
alert the name of the teams that tied and
the positions that each would share. 

Good Luck
